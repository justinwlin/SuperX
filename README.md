# What is this site for

This is a site for Superx.com, just my site where I moved my previous notion guide over to a proper website.

# Technology Stack

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ pnpm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ pnpm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ pnpm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
