# Technical Studying (Leetcode / Grokking)

## Who is this for?
This is a recommended timeline to study for algorithms. If you haven't already, please read my [General Tips to Studying](/guide/StudyingTimelines/GeneralTipsToStudying). Everything is of my own opinion.

## Algorithm Path:

**Objective**: In 3-6 months, reach a comfortable degree of proficiency with algorithms. Focus on recognizing patterns, understanding the rationale behind methods, and abstracting solutions further.

**Path**: Begin with Grokking and potentially another supplementary resource. Apply the foundational patterns you learn.

**Methodology**:
Grokking is ideal for preparing for technical interviews as it categorizes questions into distinct patterns for reuse, rather than random practice problems on Leetcode. It's akin to studying for a math exam: learn the basics, practice problems, then attempt a mock exam before the real one. Purely doing numerous problems is harder and less efficient. 

Thus, consider this methodology in two parts:

1. **Foundations**: Focus on Grokking, analyzing problems, and mastering core concepts.
2. **Grinding**: Utilize various resources to tackle a broader range of problems.

## How to Study Grokking:

### Recommended Tool:
For Python users, try [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/live.html). It lets you execute your Python code step-by-step, revealing every variable and reference.

> **Note**: The guide below is tailored to the "educative.io" version, but differences with the designguru.io version are minor. I'll indicate alternatives for both.

## Section One: 70% of Essentials

### Sliding Window
- Skip Challenge problem #4.

### Two Pointer
- Skip Challenge Problem #1. It's better to read and understand its solution.
- **Leetcode Questions with Two Pointer Strategy**:
  - [Maximize Distance to Closest Person](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-distance-to-closest-person/)
  - [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)
  - Leetcode’s version of Two Sum is also recommended. Grokking covers only sorted arrays, but be aware of unsorted array solutions. Explore other variations of Two Sum on Leetcode's related questions.
    - [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

### Matrix Traversal (For the newer version of Grokking on Design Guru)
- Complete all for thorough matrix traversal practice.

### Breadth-First-Search
- Complete all.

### Depth-First-Search
- Complete all.

### Additional Recommendations (DesignGuru Matrix Traversal):
After BFS and DFS, consider these questions to practice BFS/DFS within matrix contexts (especially vital for the educative.io Grokking version users):
  - [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)
  - [The Maze](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-maze/)
For those with DesignGuru, the section is called "Flood-fill algorithm".

## Section 2: Solid Chapters to Learn

### Fast and Slow pointer
- [Optional] Challenges #2 and #3. These are less crucial.

### Merge Interval
- Complete up to and including Challenge problem #1.

### In-Place Reversal of LinkedList
- Complete the first two problems.
- **Leetcode Recommendation**: This question employs DFS. Additionally, you should become familiar with manipulating pointers.
  - [Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/)

### Top K Elements
- Work on the first two problems, or completing all is fine too.

### Subsets
- Complete only the first 5 problems, from subsets to Balanced parenthesis.
- I suggest moving on to [Leetcode’s Backtracking Card](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-ii/472/backtracking/). Grokking could have incorporated more backtracking, but they do offer an excellent iterative perspective.

### Topological Sort
- Complete the first 4 problems, from Topological Sort to All Tasks Scheduling.

### Modified Binary Search
- Complete the first 4 problems, up to and including Number Range.
- Also recommended: Minimum Difference Element (medium).
- It might also be beneficial to implement a standard binary search. You can search for this problem on Leetcode.

### DesignGuru (monotonic stack)
On DesignGuru, you have monotonic stack section which is great to learn. For others with educative.io can read [this article](https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/2347639/A-comprehensive-guide-and-template-for-monotonic-stack-based-problems) and also search up monotonic stack questions. It isn't too complicated of a datastructure, and I wouldn't overemphasize on this.

## Section 3: Nice-to-Haves

### Tries
- Grokking doesn't teach tries, but here are two problems I recommend:
  1. Implement a prefix tree - [NeetCode Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oobqoCJlHA0&ab_channel=NeetCode)
  2. Implement a Trie - [NeetCode Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asbcE9mZz_U&t=756s&ab_channel=NeetCode)

### Two Heaps
- Complete the first two problems.

### Cyclic Sort
- Skip challenge problems.

### K Way merge
- Complete the first problem.

## Section 4: Low ROI

In my opinion, unless you have abundant free time and pursue this for personal knowledge, this isn't worth the time. I would rather people focus on DFS/BFS/Backtracking than DP. Nonetheless, it can prove helpful for continued growth.

- Refer to the Dynamic Programming section in Grokking the Coding Interview.
- I also recommend the [DesignGuru Grokking the Dynamic Programming Patterns](https://designgurus.org/course/grokking-dynamic-programming) course, which dives deeper into various problem types and patterns.

## Once Done with Grokking or Simultaneously for 20% of the Time...

It's time to delve deep. I strongly recommend:

1. [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice) - A commendable YT channel offering solutions to prevalent lists such as Blind75.
   - Blind75 is a widely-recognized community list of the top 75 questions on Leetcode.
2. [Best Practice Questions by Blind 75 Author](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/best-practice-questions) - A website of best practice questions and a comprehensive handbook curated by the Blind 75 Author.
3. [Kirb350](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bbpJkNqNorsZcNUOK5e2mYnSEGgpfR1CKqcVg9OinEo/edit#gid=0) - A centralized list of questions and topics curated by Kirbs from CSCareers.
