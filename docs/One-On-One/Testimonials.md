Below is just some of the people we've worked with. We've also helped about half-a-dozen people negotiate their salaries, helping them get an extra 10K to even surprisingly a 100K extra (between balancing and pushing back on multiple offers). Along with helping more than a dozen other people in getting offers for their job interviews. But I think the people below are most representative of the people I've worked with and have become great friends or mentees in the process.

## Tim

### Offer New Grad: Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon

**Status:**

Was my first mentee, and is/was a health major at John Hopkins. He excelled at taking my advice and flying with it.


**Testimony:**

Justin totally changed how far I thought I could go in CS and cannot thank him enough :) He mentored me for several months helping me get an internship at the top tech companies when I thought it was impossible and starting from nothing as a health major my sophomore year. He taught me algorithms, full-stack web development, and perfected my interviewing skills where I then got multiple tops offers that sophomore year, with the top ones being both Amazon and now waiting on Google team matching.
**Edit: He ended up getting Google, MFST, Meta, and Amazon Offers!~**

## Sophie 

### Bloomberg / Amazon Intern / Amazon Full Time

**Status:**

One of my mentees who got final rounds for multiple FAANG level companies, before landing an offer at Bloomberg, then an Amazon internship, and now full time. She also got into the Google team matching round, but unfortunately, Google had dropped 50% of team matches due to large layoffs in 2023.

**Testimony:**

With Justin’s help, I was able to get an offer as a college sophomore within 6 months, starting from nothing to a full stack web developer. He has a good understanding of the interview process and the patterns of the coding questions. He is also able to teach them in an explicit way which really helped me cracking the questions prior to taking any algorithm classes in school. All in all he’s an amazing mentor :D!

## Kris 

### Apple Full time

**Status:**

Consulted with Kris multiple times, as she worked her way to studying and getting an offer from both Bloomberg and Apple, and eventually taking Apple

**Testimony:**

Justin's willingness to help others is outstanding. He really understands the interviewing process through his own/friends experiences. Justin has crafted a template of "how to interview." I found myself reading over this guide before my interviews and slowly incorporating them into my interview style. He has a good sense of character, technical intellect and can detect where his clients are struggling the most. If you have the opportunity to connect and work w/ Justin, you will find he gets the job done and more!

## Mathew

### Tesla Intern / Linkedin intern / Google intern

[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathew-chanda/)

**Status:**

Gave advice to Mathew, hopping on call with him to consult on how to tackle his interviews and preparation and soon to be interviewing with other top tech companies / in the process, but ended up landing one at Tesla!

**Testimony:**

I wanted to prepare for Summer 2022 Internships by doing leetcode. However, I was never able to take my university's data structure class. So, leetcode was super hard for me! Justin walked me through the process of studying algoexpert and grokking to get better at Leetcode, which will later help me passed the first round of Google's interview process! In addition, Justin showed me how to structure my interview that was super simple and effective! I truly believed that Justin knows what he's doing and I have full faith in his teachings!
