# Who are we?

## Justin

My name is [Justin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinlinw/), I currently work at Meta on AR Glasses, and I've previously worked at Amazon as an intern and full-time. I've also received offers from companies such as: Google, Palantir, JPMC, Blizzard, IBM, and more+. Back when I was in college, I had a 2.8ish ~ 3.0 GPA, due to some personal health issues. During that time, I felt so lost on what to do, but through a lot of hard-work I compiled a methdology for getting into my first FAANG internship, and since then, [teaching many other people to do the same](/guide/One-On-One/Testimonials)
