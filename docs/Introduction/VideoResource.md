# YT Video Resource

Author: [@justinwlin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinlinw/)

If you are reading this guide, consider watching the [accompying YT video first!]((https://youtu.be/AiMCAZX0PCg?si=1P6LqQ3skyYtktq9)) While I made it in the past, and that this document will be a more up-to-date than the video, the video will give tips and help preemptively guide you in knowing how to approach the guide. 

(Do note that when editing the video, I did speed up the video / I was awkward recording it ðŸ˜…, but I still think it gives a good overview to this guide.)
