This guide is still a WIP and is being migrated from a previous guide [@justinwlin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinlinw/) [wrote in notion](https://www.notion.so/justinlinpersonal/Written-Guide-ad5593333b0540c2b9a4fab8a07f4365)

## Who is this guide for?
This guide is mainly for those aiming on getting into FAANG (or big tech companies / unicorns / or equal equivalents). And the reason why we are writing this guide is because it can be **insanely** frustrating process if you've never gone through it yourself.

But the great thing is that to get into these companies - once you know the structure and approach - it's just about practicing and trying over-and-over until something gives and you get an offer.

## Why FAANG?

Many people think FAANG companies are impossible to get into, but that's not true. It's worth applying to top tech companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, etc. as a software engineer. Entry-level employees at FAANG companies can earn around $150,000 to $200,000, depending on the location. 

And b/c these companies use algorithmic questions to assess problem-solving skills, which can be studied, it is actually not as impossible as it may seem. Working at a large company provides more resources, training, and support. Contrary to popular belief, you don't have to work long hours to succeed. Whereas smaller companies may actually require more knowledge and expertise, have fewer resources, and offer lower pay. Now every person's experience may differ, but just from my own experience working at a startup, I personally had just experienced the difference between a smaller or larger company culture.
