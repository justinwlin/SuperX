# When do interview seasons start?
This guide **primarily assumes** that most students are looking for internships during the summer. If this is the case, then please be aware that the interview season for summer internships usually starts around **September 1st**. This is the optimal time to start applying. 

What this means is that you should count how many Septembers you have left until you graduate to categorize yourself as a new graduate or an intern. For example:
Let's say that you started school in Sept 2021, and you will graduate around May/June of 2024.

September 2021 - Freshmen internship <br/>
September 2022 - Sophomore internship<br/>
September 2023 - Junior Internship<br/>
September 2024 - New Grad<br/>

(And something most people don't know is that post-1 year of graduating, so September 2025 interview season, you will still count as a new grad to most companies. This is actually what I did, where when I graduated I worked full-time at Amazon, and continued to do new grad interview when I received my offers at Meta / Google.)

## Specific timeline:
So my recommended timeline is as follows:
September 1st to October 30th - this is the main time to apply to companies. Obviously, if you see companies that continue to post jobs after this time, feel free to keep applying. 

October 1st to November 15th - This is primarily where people will begin to receive online assessments.

October 20th through December 31st - Phone interviews / final round interviews will be given, and people will begin to receive offers around this time. 

**NOW** this is not a "hard-set" timeline and there are exceptions. For example, I know a couple of my mentees in their sophmore and junior year, the applied through September and October, but didn't hear back till January / February even though the company was interviewing other people during that time. We theorize it's because they were a sophmore, but just to be clear, it does happen that I've seen people even apply in November and December, and get interviews in February and March. 

But the reason why I try to follow the timeline I recommended is b/c the later you apply, the least headcount there might be. With these large companies, they generally do have enough headcount where it shouldn't be an issue, but it sometimes does happen that the later you apply, the more people will have applied by then, the less resource and time recruiters have to process newer candidates. This is why I personally do recommend to apply early. But again, this is not a hard-set rule. Even for myself, after I had gotten my offer from Google in December, was only then I reached out to a Meta recruiter for an interview in January. So certaintly, the timeline is flexible, but I do recommend to apply when I recommend. 

### Applying Earlier than September 1st
Now, there are some people who "worry" - I see this every year, who apply in June, July, August. And in general, I do not recommend this. The reason why is b/c most companies are not ready to interview you. For example, Meta sometimes releases their positions in June / July. But I have talked directly to two recruiters, who told me that they wouldn't start reaching out officially till September. And I've seen some people's application even just get forgotten. Some companies like Amazon, does interview that early actually in June / July, but then my issue with this is that unless you are ready, you just sliced your time to study by a few months. 

So I do not recommend applying earlier than September 1st. Also please do not worry, if there aren't many jobs, or things aren't moving as fast as you think it should if it's September. It takes the companies some time to begin to send things out and process applications. I also just see a lot of people worry every year b/c of it.

Now here are the exceptions:
1. Banks usually release their positions for students in early or mid august. Especially JPMC for example will do so. I also recommend to apply for their Code For Good, which usually opens up applications in August. This is b/c JP Morgan Chase hackathon is a place where they HEAVILY draw from for their internship cohort. So if you are interested in JPMC, I do recommend to apply to Code For Good. (I've seen people even just do basic HTML during the hackathon and get an internship offer from JPMC). But obviously, try to put your best foot forward and learn some better web development skills beforehand.

2. There are a few other companies like Robinhood, or other unicorns that will open up their applications in August. Just due to their usually small cohort size, I do think applying early if they come out is worth it. 

3. Sometimes, Google is a bit weird and usually release their applications between September 15th and October 15th, which they keep online for a couple of months. But sometimes, they open up in addition to the September 15th application, one in mid-August, and only keep it up for a couple of weeks. I am not sure why, but if you see it, I recommend to apply to it.
