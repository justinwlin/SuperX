These are some definitions you should know when interviewing. 

| Words | Definition |
|-------|------------|
| Behavioral Interview | When you are tested on questions about your behavior and thought process. |
| Technical Interview | When you are tested on algorithmic-like questions or questions related to your subject matter expertise. |
| Online Assessment (OA) | Companies will often first send out an online assessment. These assessments often test algorithmic-like questions that you will find on Leetcode, or if you are in DS/ML, they can test you additionally on SQL or other related subject matters. |
| Phone Interview | Often following the online assessment will be a phone interview. This means an interview over the phone or webcam, where you will be given a shared editor and you need to answer algorithmic questions on the phone. This often serves as an initial screening. This usually consists of 1 and sometimes rarely even 2 rounds of interviews. |
| Final Round (aka super day) | If you pass the OA/phone interview, you will be given a final round which can consist of usually around 3 to 5 rounds of interviews. (This can be less if you are interviewing for internship, potentially even just 1 round.) These interviews are mainly technical interviews, with maybe 1 behavioral round. |
