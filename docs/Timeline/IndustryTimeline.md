# Industry Timeline

Author: [@justinwlin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinlinw/)

In my opinion, I find that the industry timeline is quite flexible. Obviously during holidays, such as Christmas, is the time things might be a bit weird due to holidays, but I was able to interview year round. 

I think the bigger thing for industry is to figure out how to get the interviews, which mean: referrals, networking on Linkedin, and cold-emailing.

The reality is that coming in as industry means that your response rate will typically be lowered ~ what I've heard around 2%-5%.

You have to imagine that there are tens of thousands of engineers trying to get into FAANG, how do they differentiate between those applying, with several years of experience versus another.

This is just what I have heard above, and it might not be representative of everyoneâ€™s experience, but I do not think it hurts to network and get in contact with a recruiter which is the ultimate goal, and hopefully that recruiter can help schedule an interview.
