# Hello World!

Welcome to my blog! My name is Justin Lin, I'm a software engineer, and this is a place for me to just document things that I want to share. Often there might be projects, random thoughts, or instructional posts. I hope you enjoy!

If you are interested to contact me, feel free to reach out to me at
